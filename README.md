# AliasHelper

## How to use it:

Add a file named "alias.json" in the directory where you want to execute the aliases and structure it like this 

```
{
  "alias_name": "command arg1 arg2",
  "another_name": "command2 arg3 arg4"
}
```

Then you just call "alias alias_name" in the terminal and (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ <br>
(after adding the compiled exe to the enviroment variables)
